"GIULIANI: I can't comment on Fred. I can tell you that George Will wrote a couple of years back, toward the end of my time of being mayor of New York City, that I ran the most conservative government in the United States in the last 50 or 60 years. So I would think that was a pretty good indication of the things that he was drawing on. I brought down crime more than anyone in this country -- maybe in the history of this country -- while I was mayor of New York City.",
"GIULIANI: I brought down taxes, $9 billion, cut them 23 times. I balanced the budget that was perennially out of balance; removed $2.3 billion surpluses -- deficits and replaced them with surpluses.",
"So there were many -- I drove pornography out of Times Square. There were many, many things about my governing of New York that particularly in that environment -- one of the most liberal cities in the country -- I had more success than anyone ever thought I could have with a city council that was 45 Democrats and, I think it was, six Republicans -- then it went down to five at one point.",
"GIULIANI: So I think that was a pretty darn good conservative record. I think, in every case, you can always find one exception or two to someone being absolutely conservative or absolutely this or absolutely that, but I think I had a heck of a lot of conservative results.",
"GIULIANI: Well, look, you know...",
"GIULIANI: ... well, first of all, you know, you do one of those things and -- you know, Fred has his problems, too.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"I mean, Fred was the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the United States Senate. He stood with Democrats over and over again.",
"He voted against $250,000 caps on damages, which they have in Texas. He voted against almost anything that would make our legal system fairer: loser pays rules, things that would prevent lawsuits like that $54 million lawsuit by that guy who lost his pants -- you know?",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"GIULIANI: That cost that family $100,000 in legal fees. I think the man should have to pay the family for the $100,000 that he took from them in the abusive lawsuit.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"Fred Thompson, along with very few Republicans, blocked tort reform over and over and over again. That is not a conservative position.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: Oh, the simple fact is that New York City had a policy of allowing people who are illegal immigrants to report crime and to put their children in school. Otherwise, we reported every single illegal immigrant that committed a crime.",
"The results had to be pretty darn good. I brought down crime by over 60 percent in New York City. I brought down homicide by 67 percent. I had the most legal city in the country. And I took the crime capital of America and I turned it into the safest large city in the country.",
"The senator has never had executive responsibility. He's never had the weight of people's safety and security on his shoulders.",
"I have. And I think I out-performed any expectations.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: I think you said that opposite, and the first part is wrong also, Carl. I have always -- I've always had...",
"GIULIANI: I've always had the same position.",
"GIULIANI: I do not believe under the state that we presently exist, with the Defense of Marriage Act and basically one state that has by judicial fiat created same-sex marriage -- and they're wrong, by the way; I think the governor is absolutely right -- I don't think we need a constitutional amendment at this point.",
"What I said to Mr. Perkins -- which I also said five years ago and have consistently said -- is if a lot of states start to do that, three, four, five, six states, where we have that kind of judicial activism, and the kind of situation the governor is talking about actually occurs, if we're dealing with a real problem, then we should have a constitutional amendment.",
"I did 210 weddings when I was mayor of New York City. So I have experience doing this. They were all men and women.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"I hope.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: You got to give me a little slack here. It was New York City, you know, but...",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"GIULAINI: It is a religious institution, but Congressman Paul is wrong; it's a civil institution as well. That's why I did those 210 weddings, because it's also a civil institution.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: I couldn't get that. I'm sorry, Wendell.",
"GIULIANI: Well, I mean, because what we need is choice. I'll give you a -- probably...",
"GIULIANI: Well, I'm actually -- I love teachers. I think teachers are wonderful. There are great ones, there are average ones and there are bad ones, but I really care about the kids more. Sorry, Wendell.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"And I just want to tell you a little story, because this is the thing that made me feel very strongly about choice. There was a school scholarship program about 1996, '97 -- they offered 2,500 scholarships to parents of public school children in New York City if they wanted to send their child to a private school, a parochial school, a charter school.",
"GIULIANI: We had 168,000 applications by those parents. We had to turn most of them down. We had to tell them because they don't have enough money, they couldn't put the child in the school of their choice.",
"It seems to me the thing that's wrong right at the core of No Child Left Behind is the enforcer of standards should not be the bureaucrat in Washington or on the board of education. It should be the parent. We should have choice. We should empower parents. They should decide -- private school, parochial school, public school, charter school, home school.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"That will give the parents the kind of control over their children's education. They understand their children better. Why should a government bureaucrat be sending 168,000 children to failing schools when parents think they can do better for their children? I think it's the single biggest civil rights issue that we face in the 21st century.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: You got to be kidding.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"You have got to be kidding.",
"Wait a second. There is -- there are two things I agree with Hillary Clinton on. First of all, we're both Yankee fans.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"Well, wait a second. I became a Yankee fan growing up in New York. She became a Yankee fan growing up in Chicago.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"Do you believe that?",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"Second, she made a statement last week -- and I've been very critical of her, but I want to tell her I agree with this one. Quote, Hillary Clinton, I have a million ideas; America cannot afford them all.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"I'm not making it up. I am not making it up.",
"The transcription contains a gap at this point.",
"(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: Thank you.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"You saved us in 2000. That was a big one.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"I'd also like to note, on behalf of all my Republican colleagues, we're not going to boycott Florida the way the Democrats are.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"We're going to be here, campaigning for your vote.",
"GIULIANI: Was that question for me?",
"GIULIANI: OK. I think the reality is that we have to deal with Social Security.",
"The first thing we have to do is get a consensus behind private accounts if we're going to change it.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"It doesn't make much sense to figure out what the compromises are going to be if you can't get the big thing that you need to really change Social Security. And the fact is, Medicare and Medicaid and presently more expensive than Social Security.",
"GIULIANI: And within 10 years, they'll be twice as expensive. So they're going to go bankrupt a lot faster. And they need a private solution as well.",
"What we need to do if we're going to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid is bring down the cost of the entire health insurance market.",
"And in the discussion you were having about health insurance before, the point that I think was missed -- we only have 17 million people in America who buy their own health insurance. If we have 50 million or 60 million people who bought their own health insurance, the price of health insurance would be cut in more than half.",
"And the way you cover the people that aren't presently covered -- the people who aren't presently covered with health insurance are not the poorest people; they're covered with Medicaid.",
"The people who are presently not covered are all buying something -- they're consumers. They may be buying a television, they may be buying -- I hate to mention a cellphone, but they may be buying a cellphone.",
"But in any event, they have -- they have consumer power. They have to start getting into that market. It's the only way in which you bring down costs.",
"So I think in both cases, if you start to establish a private market, you're going to be able to figure out how to solve these things within costs that are sustainable.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"GIULIANI: There's no question that the idea of going to war with Iran, or even taking military action against Iran would be very dangerous. It would be something you would not want to do. It would be a last resort.",
"But if you're asking me the question, which is more dangerous, a nuclear-armed Iran is more dangerous.",
"And it should be the clear position of the United States government that we will not allow them to become -- to become nuclear.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"And I honestly believe -- and, again, I think this comes from the wisdom of Ronald Reagan -- if we can be clear about this, and our allies can understand this, and China and Russia can understand that we would take action to stop them from becoming nuclear, in our judgment, you know, when that has to happen, if they thought we were very serious about that, I think the chance of the sanctions working -- direct, indirect, disinvestment from Iran, I think the sanctions working would work much more effectively.",
"China and Russia have, obviously, economic interests in dealing with Iran. What they have to see is that America would act. And if America acted, that would be inconsistent with what would be good for them.",
"You've got to understand, in foreign affairs, just like in the affairs of people, self-interest is enormously important. You've got to figure out the other person's self-interest, and then you have to deal with that.",
"And I think our taking a strong position here would be similar to the difference between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, when he was dealing with Iran.",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"Jimmy Carter had hostages for 444 days. In one hour, the Iranians released the hostages. And they saw something different in Ronald Reagan's eyes than in Jimmy Carter's eyes."
