"OBAMA: We need to put those tax breaks and tax loopholes back into the pockets of hardworking Americans.",
"OBAMA: We are not going to be able to dig ourselves out of that hole in one or two years. But if we can get on a path of sustained growth, if we can end the war in Iraq, end some of the special interest loopholes and earmarks that have been clogging up the system, then I think we can return to a path of a balanced budget.",
"OBAMA: Well, every proposal I've put forward during this campaign, we have paid for. And we have specified where that money is going to come from.",
"But let's just look at our tax code, because it's a great example of how we could provide some relief to ordinary citizens who are struggling to get by.",
"Right now, we've got a whole host of corporate loopholes and tax savings. There's a building in the Cayman Islands that houses, supposedly, 12,000 U.S.-based corporations.",
"OBAMA: Now, that's either the biggest building in the world or the biggest tax scam in the world. And I think we know which one it is.",
"If we close some of those loopholes, that helps me to pay for an offset on the payroll tax that effects all Americans.",
"We've put forward tax relief plans for those that are making less than $75,000 a year. That will not only restore fairness to our tax code, but it also puts money into the pockets of hard-working Americans who need it right now, who will spend it, and it will actually improve our economic growth over time, particularly at a time when we're seeing a credit crunch.",
"But what it requires is some leadership from the White House that restores that sense that we're all in this together and that we're not just on our own.",
"OBAMA: Well, just to emphasize how important prevention and cost savings can be in the Medicare system, it's estimated if we went back to the obesity rates that existed in 1980, that would save the Medicare system $1 trillion.",
"So many of the reforms that I've suggested in my health care plan will reduce costs not just for the overall system, but also for Medicare.",
"OBAMA: But one thing I have to say: We are not going to make some of these changes unless we change how business is done in Washington.",
"The reason that we can't negotiate for prescription drugs under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan is because the drug companies specifically sought and obtained a provision in that bill that prevented us from doing it.",
"OBAMA: And unless we change that politics, we're going to continue to see the waste that we're seeing in the entitlement programs.",
"OBAMA: Thank you, Carolyn.",
"You know, 40 years ago, Dr. King challenged America to act on what he called the fierce urgency of now.",
"And I feel that urgency today. Our nation's at war. The planet's in peril. And Americans and Iowans are working harder and harder just to keep pace.",
"Now, I am confident that we can meet these challenges. I believe we can provide better economic security, that we can restore our standing in the world, and that we can make sure that our children have a brighter future.",
"OBAMA: But we can only do it if we have the courage to change, if we can bring the country together, if we can push back against the special interests, and if we level with the American people about how we're going to solve our problems.",
"That's the kind of campaign I've tried to run, and that's the kind of president I intend to be.",
"I ask that all of you caucus for me.",
"OBAMA: Well, there's no doubt that NAFTA needs to be amended. And I've already said that I would contact the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada, to make sure that the labor and environmental agreements are actually enforceable in the same way that patent protections and other things that are important to corporate America are enforceable.",
"But I did want to just go back, briefly, to the issue of trade and human rights that you had mentioned earlier.",
"OBAMA: I think that folks made a terrific point that we have to stand for human rights and that should be part of the trade equation.",
"It is harder for us to do it when we have situations like Guantanamo, where we suspended habeas corpus.",
"To the extent that we are not being true to our values and our ideals, that sends a negative message to the world and it gives us less leverage then when we want to deal with countries that are abusing human rights.",
"So I think it's part and parcel with a larger program of us restoring the traditions that made this country great and made us admired around the world.",
"OBAMA: This is a moral imperative. I've got a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old daughter. And I want to make sure that the planet is as beautiful for them as it was for me.",
"Now, what that means is, there are going to be some increases initially, in electricity prices, for example, if we have a cap-and- trade system.",
"Over time, technology will adapt because investors and people who are looking to make money will see that they can make money through green technologies. We're already seeing this. In Keokuk, they're just opening a plant right now that is going to provide 400 well- paying jobs to build wind turbines. And that's the promise of the future.",
"But, in order for this to happen, we've got to be courageous enough to not just talk about it in front of the Sierra Club, or organizations that are already sympathetic to us.",
"When I announced my proposal to increase fuel efficiency standards on cars, I went to Detroit, in front of the auto makers, and said they had to change their ways.",
"OBAMA: And I have to say, the room was really quiet...",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"... and nobody clapped.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"But that's OK, because part of what the next president has to do is not just tell the American people what they want to hear; has to tell them what they need to hear.",
"OBAMA: I have made as a centerpiece for my world farm agenda that we lower the subsidies, that we cap the subsidies because too many of them are going to agribusiness.",
"OBAMA: We've got folks in Manhattan who are getting farm subsidies. We've got Fortune 500 companies who are getting farm subsidies. And as a consequence, family farms are getting squeezed up and you're seeing more and more consolidation. This is something you hear about all across rural Iowa.",
"So what I would do is I would cap those subsidies. I think we have to have a structure that provides protection to farmers from drought or collapse in market prices. But we have to take money that is saved, invest in conservation, invest in organic and alternative crops, invest in nutrition programs.",
"Through that process, we can not only save the land, but we can also improve the economic engines in a lot of these rural communities. And that is something that I'm absolutely committed to doing as president of the United States, but it's going to require overcoming the excess influence of agribusiness in Washington.",
"OBAMA: There were elements of the proposal on Tuesday that I think did not make the changes the way I would have approached it. So I probably would have voted against it.",
"But there was a vote today that I voted for that would have capped the subsidies so that it wouldn't be going to these folks who don't deserve it.",
"OBAMA: A lot of good ideas have been mentioned.",
"Early childhood education, that will close the achievement gap that we see, particularly for minority children, because often times they are already behind when they start school.",
"Not just talking about how great teachers are, but giving them more money and more support.",
"Changing No Child Left Behind so that we're not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music that are so critical.",
"OBAMA: But you asked earlier about sacrifices that I'll ask from the American people.",
"One of the things that I want to do is get parents reengaged in instilling a sense of excellence in their children. And I've said this all across the country when I talk to parents about education: Government has to fulfill its obligations to fund education, but parents have to do their job, too.",
"We've got to turn off the TV set, we've got to put away the video game and we have to tell our children that education is not a passive activity; it is something that you have to be actively engaged in.",
"If we encourage that kind of attitude and our whole community is reinforcing, then I have no doubt that we can compete with anybody in the world.",
"OBAMA: I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and tell them they have a new mission, which is to, in a responsible, careful way, end this war in Iraq, bring our combat troops home. I will initiate the kind of diplomacy that's necessary to stabilize the country and the region as we're pulling out.",
"OBAMA: Number two, I'll call in my new attorney general to review every single executive order that's been issued by George Bush. And any of those that have undermined our Constitution or subverted our civil liberties are going to be reversed.",
"Number three, we're going to have an open conversation with all the key players in the health care arena to make sure that we are moving forward on a plan to provide coverage to every single American, and to save money so that we can actually afford it over the long haul.",
"OBAMA: I just want to -- I just wanted to make the comment: I've worked with Joe Biden.",
"OBAMA: I've seen his leadership. I have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that he's made with respect to racial equality in this country.",
"So I will provide some testimony, as they say in church...",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"... that Joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better America.",
"OBAMA: Well, the -- you know, I am...",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"OBAMA: Well, Hillary, I'm looking forward to you advising me, as well.",
"(LAUGHTER)",
"(APPLAUSE)",
"I want to gather up (inaudible) from everywhere.",
"You know, we haven't talked too much about the war, but one of the points that I've tried to make during the course of this year during the campaign is, I want to change the mindset that got us into war.",
"Because I think that since 9/11, we've had a president who essentially fed us a politics of fear and distorted our foreign policy in profound ways.",
"OBAMA: And I think that there are a lot of good people, in the Clinton years, the Carter years, George Bush I, who understand that our military power is just one component of our power.",
"And I revere what our military does. And I will do whatever it takes, as commander in chief, to keep the American people safe. But I know that part of making us safe is restoring our respect in the world.",
"And I think those who are advising me agree with that. And part of the agenda that we're putting forward, in terms of talking not just to our friends but also to our enemies, initiating contacts with Muslim leaders around the world, doubling our efforts in terms of foreign aid -- all those are designed to create long-term security by creating long-term prosperity around the world.",
"OBAMA: Well, I want to be a better father, be a better husband, and I want to remind myself, constantly, that this is not about me, what I'm doing today.",
"It's an enormous strain on the family. And yesterday I went and bought a Christmas tree with my girls. And we had about two hours before we had to fly back to Washington to vote. And the only reason that is worth that sacrifice is if somehow my participation in public life is having a broader impact on their lives and the lives of children all across the country.",
"OBAMA: And so I have to constantly remind myself not to be timid, not to be distorted by the fears of losing in order to make a real difference in the lives of the American people.",
"OBAMA: Well, I think that the Iowa caucuses give people a chance to lift the hood and kick the tires and take us out for a test drive.",
"But, you know, what I've been struck by is just the core decency of the American people. I think their instincts are good.",
"And sometimes they don't get the information they need, but when they're presented with good choices, they make the right decision. There's a generosity of spirit there that I think the next president can tap.",
"And I'm looking forward to doing well in the caucuses and looking forward to leading this country."
