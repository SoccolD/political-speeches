"TRUMP: Actually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the — which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it — but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.",
"I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I'm in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush, by the way.",
"TRUMP: Let me tell you, something, Ted. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can...[applause]",

"TRUMP: You're the — you're the one. You're the one.",
"TRUMP: You're the one. Now, let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. [crosstalk]",
"Excuse me. Excuse me. I've given my answer, Lyin' Ted. I've given my answer.",
"TRUMP: Oh, stop it.",

"Then he goes, we have five. And — well, excuse me, I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him, it's like — I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn't one person that didn't say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take — how does he take five and say it's better than 10?",

"This is the man that was the primary supporter. And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read — I've read plenty of it. There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him. And it was a very, very big mistake.",
