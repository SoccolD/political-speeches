"TRUMP: ... Oh, yeah, yeah...",
"TRUMP: ... Let 44 million in New Hampshire, it was practically [inaudible]...",
"TRUMP: ... 44 million — give me a break.",
"TRUMP: You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. [booing]",

"TRUMP: I don't want to go. [laughter]",
"TRUMP: Look...[applause]...When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn't even a subject. If I didn't bring it up, we wouldn't even be talking. Now, I don't often agree with Marco, and I don't often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush.

"He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.",
"[crosstalk]",
"TRUMP: By the way...",
"TRUMP: Take a look at your numbers.",
"TRUMP: Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.",
